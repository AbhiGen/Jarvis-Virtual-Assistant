# Jarvis Virtual Assistant

Welcome to Jarvis Virtual Assistant, a Python-based AI assistant inspired by Tony Starkâ€™s JARVIS from the Iron Man series. Jarvis integrates advanced technologies to create a functional, interactive, and secure personal assistant. Jarvis combines voice recognition and system control to streamline tasks and provide real-time information.

## Features

### Voice Recognition and Command Execution
- Listens to voice inputs and converts them into actionable commands.
- Executes tasks like opening applications, web searches, or retrieving system info.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Understands and processes a wide range of user queries intelligently.
- Responds contextually using advanced NLP techniques.

### Integration with Web APIs
- Fetches real-time data such as weather updates, news, and stock prices.
- Delivers up-to-date information via voice responses.

### System Control Capabilities
- Performs system-level tasks like shutting down the PC, opening files, or controlling media.
- Enhances user control over their device.

### User Interface (UI) Enhancements
- Features a graphical interface to display assistant status and system info.
- Provides a visual feedback loop for user interactions.

### Modular and Scalable Architecture
- Built with modularity for easy feature expansion.
- Designed to scale with future enhancements.

## Technologies Used

Jarvis leverages a robust tech stack to deliver its capabilities:
- **Python 3.8+**: Core language for development and scripting.
- **speech_recognition**: Enables voice input processing with Google Speech API support.
- **pyttsx3**: Provides offline text-to-speech for voice output.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Enhances NLP capabilities with pre-trained models (token stored securely).
- **requests**: Fetches data from web APIs (e.g., weather, news).
- **os & subprocess**: Executes system-level commands for control tasks.
- **tkinter**: Creates the graphical user interface for visual feedback.
- **python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables (e.g., API tokens) securely.

## Prerequisites

To run Jarvis, ensure you have the following:
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Microphone**: For voice input.
- **Internet Connection**: For API integrations.
